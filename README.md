C-boilerplate
=============

Introduction
-------------
C-boilerplate is just that. A simple starting point for C projects for systems that are equipped with gcc, GNU Make and bash. C-boilerplate will quickly and easily create a common directory structure that is often seen in C projects. In addition, it comes with basic functionality for building tests, packaging and installing your project as a static library.

Setup
------------
To create a project using C-boilerplate, simply copy the Makefile to the desired directory. From the project directory, simply run this command from the terminal.

`make setup`

You will then be prompted for a project name (no spaces), and the path to a desired text editor (optional).

Note: The setup *will* modify the Makefile for this project, so if you desire to use C-boilerplate for other projects, please preserve a clean copy.
